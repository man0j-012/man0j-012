### 👋 About Me

Hey there! I’m Manoj Myneni, and my love for computer science started in a fun, unexpected way—playing **Pokémon Fire Red** on my Gameboy Advance. 🎮 While playing, I encountered graph theory, which helped me optimize routes within the game, and I realized just how powerful technology can be in problem-solving.

This curiosity led me to pursue a **Bachelor’s in Technology**, where I built a strong foundation in **data structures, computer networks, operating systems,** and **machine learning**. After graduation, I joined **LTIMindtree** as a **Software Engineer**, working with **Citibank North America** on backend development. There, I gained hands-on experience with **Java, Spring Boot, and REST APIs**, creating financial dashboards and developing scalable microservices to tackle complex business challenges. 💻

Eager to deepen my understanding of the tech landscape, I pursued a **Master’s in Computer Science** at the **University of Illinois Chicago**. My journey here allowed me to dive into **Computer Vision** and **Human-Robot Interaction**. I even had my research accepted at the **Colorado Boulder ACM/IEEE International Conference**! Additionally, I collaborated with the **Honda Research Institute USA** on a **Unity-based study** evaluating acknowledgment feedback from robots and humans, boosting user engagement by 27%. 🤖
