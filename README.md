My journey in computer science began with my love for gaming, sparked by *Pokémon Fire Red* on my Gameboy Advance 🎮. Inquisitiveness and yearning to expand my horizons through systems, Computers, algorithms, and Networking has become my second nature since then.  Henceforth, I have embraced challenges across multiple domains, learning from mistakes, growing, and striving to "fail better."
