My journey in computer science began with my love for gaming, sparked by *Pokémon Fire Red* on my Gameboy Advance 🎮. This passion evolved into a Bachelor’s in Technology, where I laid a solid foundation in data structures, computer networks, and machine learning. Since then, I have embraced challenges across multiple domains, learning from mistakes, growing, and striving to "fail better."
